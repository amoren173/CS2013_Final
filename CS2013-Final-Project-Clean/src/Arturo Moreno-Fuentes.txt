This is my project.

There are some things I could not implement since I did not have time due to my finals. 

For example, I was not able to implement being able to implement the logic to use the potions or shield potions. I also needed to implement the ability to see the inventory items. Another thing was that the cost of moving between rooms still does not affect the player.

However, I implemented many new things, such as randomly assigning monsters and items to the Rooms. There are also other things I implemented that do not need talking since they deal with logic.
